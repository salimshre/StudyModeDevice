4.  **Debloat:** Use a root app like **Titanium Backup** to remove system apps you don't need (e.g., Facebook, Instagram).
5.  **Set Up a Minimal Launcher:** Install a launcher like **Olauncher** or **Niagara Launcher** to hide all apps except your essential tools.

### For Unrooted Users (Still Powerful)
